Hi team,

I wanted to share the Q1 2024 planning update for ProductA. We have several key initiatives planned:

1. Performance optimization: 30% improvement target
2. New API endpoints: REST and GraphQL support
3. Enhanced monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana integration
4. Security hardening: Penetration testing and vulnerability remediation

Please review the attached roadmap and provide feedback by end of this week.

Best regards,
John Smith
